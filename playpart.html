        This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p><br>

        <p class = "speech">Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p><br>

        <p class = "speech">Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
        tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
        of money.</p><br>
        
        <h6 class="helmer">HELMER.</h6>
        <p class = "speech">Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
        salary is due.</p><br>

        <p class = "speech">Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p><br>

        little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
        and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
        a slate fell on my head and killed me, </p>
