    <h1>Asritha acts in a play</h1>
    <h2>A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>Don’t disturb me.</p> <p>_[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
        the room, pen in hand.]_ </p><p>Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
        little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p><br>
        
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
        This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p><br>
        
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        <p>Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p><br>
        
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a

        <p>Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
        salary is due.</p><br>
        
        <h6>NORA.</h6>
        <p>Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p><br>
        
        <h6>HELMER.</h6>
        Nora! <p>_[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]_</p><p>The same
        little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
        and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
        a slate fell on my head and killed me, </p>
